# N-Multi-Hashing
[![Build Status](https://github.com/SkinnyPeteTheGiraffe/n-multi-hashing/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/SkinnyPeteTheGiraffe/n-multi-hashing/actions/workflows/test.yml?query=branch%3Amain+)

_For list of supported Algorithms, scroll to bottom of README_

A rewrite of [node-multi-hashing](https://github.com/SkinnyPeteTheGiraffe/node-multi-hashing) in Typescript,
more algorithms, and proper unit testing. This version should be much more stable, as full coverage unit testing, will
ensure consistency of hashing functions, warning developers of any breaking changes. This version will also include
more algorithms, and will continue to add them as development continues.

## Inspiration
When I first got into crypto development, I forked [node-multi-hashing](https://github.com/SkinnyPeteTheGiraffe/node-multi-hashing)
and added a few algorithms, but admittedly was still novice in terms of development. I have gained much more experience,
and decided to re-write (not algorithms) my past work, and added features I have found to be valuable (such as unit testing).

## Requirements
While these are not all hard requirements, I have listed what I used to develop/build this project to give more guidance.

| Requirement  |  Version |
|--------------|----------|
| Unix OS      | Ubuntu*  |
| NodeJS       | ~12.x.x  |
| yarn         | 1.21.1   |
| gcc          | ~9.x.x   |
| node-gyp     | ^8.1.0   |

`* Can be anything`

## Getting Started
A simple usage example to get you started.
```js
import multiHashing from 'n-multi-hashing';

const hash = multiHashing.x16r( Buffer.from('ffff0000', 'hex'));
```

### Contributions
Anyone is free to fork/clone this project and use at their own will. Though if you would like help develop this project,
I have listed some things to note in order for your PR to be accepted.
  * When creating a PR, be descriptive about your changes, and keep your code clean and maintainable.
  * If adding algorithms, please include associated unit-tests.
  * Ensure your changes pass the CI/CD pipeline (check the Actions tab).
